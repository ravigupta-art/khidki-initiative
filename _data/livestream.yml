- videotitle: "From Animation to Live-Action Filmmaking | by Palash Vaswani | KHIDKI"
  videodescription: It is believed that for an animation filmmaker, making a live-action film is very difficult. To become a live-action filmmaker, one has to go through formal training of traditional filmmaking. In reality, it is exactly the opposite. Learning the art of animation filmmaking can only make you a better storyteller/filmmaker. The form is just a medium.
